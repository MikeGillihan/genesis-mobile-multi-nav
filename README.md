Genesis Mobile Multi Nav
========================

Concatenates multiple Genesis nav menus into one mobile nav drop down. Intended to be used with the [Genesis Framework Sample Child Theme](http://my.studiopress.com/themes/genesis/) or Brian Gardner's [Mobile First Child Theme](http://briangardner.com/themes/mobile-first/).


This is mostly a proof of concept for another [project](https://github.com/MikeGillihan/GeneSass) I am working on. It hasn't been tested and isn't complete. There are still plenty of issues with the plugin so use it at your own risk!
