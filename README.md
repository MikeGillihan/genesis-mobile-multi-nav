Genesis Mobile Multi Nav
========================

Concatenates multiple Genesis nav menus into one mobile nav drop down. Intended to be used with the [Genesis Framework Sample Child Theme](http://my.studiopress.com/themes/genesis/) or Brian Gardner's [Mobile First Child Theme](http://briangardner.com/themes/mobile-first/).

There are still plenty of issues with the plugin so use it at your own risk!
